### What is a shell?
A shell, or **command interpreter**, is a software program that provides a user interface to access the services offered by the operating system. Depending on the type of interface used we can find different types of shell:
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**
- **Graphical-User Interface (GUI)**
- **Natural-User Interface (NUI)**

Shells are necessary to execute the different commands available on the computer.

### What is bash?
**GNU Bash** is the Unix shell and command language. It is a **command interpreter** that generally runs in a text window (CLI) where the user writes commands in text mode. Bash can also read and execute commands from a file called **script**. The reserved words, syntax, environment variables, and other simple features are copied from the sh shell (Bourne Shell). Since bash can read user commands and respond accordingly, bash works as an **intermediary between the Linux kernel and users or programs**.<br>
However, there are many more bash-like shells. If we look in the **/etc/shells** file we will find all the shell types that we can use on our computer. Although we should not confuse bash with a terminal, they work together but are not the same.
