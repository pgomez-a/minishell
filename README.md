### What is a shell?
A shell, or **command interpreter**, is a software program that provides a user interface to access the services offered by the operating system. Depending on the type of interface used we can find different types of shell:
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**
- **Graphical-User Interface (GUI)**
- **Natural-User Interface (NUI)**
Shells are necessary to execute the different commands available on the computer.
